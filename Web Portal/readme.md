#Web Portal Instructions

In order to properly run the web portal on your local machine,
perform the following simple steps

  -Ensure PHP is installed and updated
  -Ensure proper ports (8080 in this example) are open and firewall is not blocking emails (happens on Syracuse campus wifi)
  -Open the 'Web Portal' directory in terminal
  -Enter the command `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080`
  -Visit localhost:8080 or the ip and port entered (127.0.0.1:8080) in any web browser to use the web portal
